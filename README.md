This is a new repository for [MindRaider project](http://mindraider.sf.net) development 
and sustainment. The main reason for the move from SF to GitHub is my projects
consolidation, efficiency and developer community that enables productivity.

*Major* releases will be released through both channels (GitHub and SF), development
and fix/minor releases to be done on GitHub.
